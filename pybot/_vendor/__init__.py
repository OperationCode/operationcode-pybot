Vendored dependencies for operationcode-pybot.

These are modified copies of abandoned libraries, updated for Python 3.12+:
- sirbot: https://github.com/pyslackers/sir-bot-a-lot-2 (MIT License)
- slack-sansio: https://github.com/pyslackers/slack-sansio (MIT License)

Both libraries were last updated in 2019-2020 and are no longer maintained.
We vendor them here with minimal modifications for modern Python compatibility.
